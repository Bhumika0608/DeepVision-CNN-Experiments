# DeepVision-CNN-Experiments
This project explores how deep neural networks learn visual representations by building, analyzing, and extending convolutional architectures. We trained CNNs on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, applied transfer learning to classify Greek letters, and experimented with network architecture and fixed Gabor filters.
